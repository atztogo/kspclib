How to use tetrahedron_method example
======================================

This is the README file for tetrahedron_method examples .

Linear tetrahedron method
--------------------------

tetrahedron_method.c relies only kgrid.c and kgrid.h. To compile
tetrahedron.c::

   % gcc tetrahedron.c [source directory]/tetrahedron_method.c [source directory]/kgrid.c -I[include directory]

tetrahedron.c is written to work with OpenMP. To compile with "-lgomp
-fopenmp", the tetrahedon method calculation is distributed into CPU
cores.
